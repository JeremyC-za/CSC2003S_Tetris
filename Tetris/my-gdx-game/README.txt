TITLE: Tetris

Description:

The is a remake of Tetris, made using LibGDX and programmed in java. The game has 6 blocks in total, made from individual 4 blocks. I tried to include shapes using 3 blocks, but encountered too many errors and had to scrap the idea.
The additional feature in my game is that you can rotate blocks through other blocks, provided that they don't pass through the edges of the grid. This helps the player get out of tough situations, but also gives some blocks new
purposes. For the music, almost a year ago I found the video "FantomenK - A Tiny Spaceship's Final Mission" on youtube. I emailed him after finding his email address on his youtube channel, asking for his permission to use his music
in my game, which he agreed to. For the blocks, I found a block online, but then opened it in Photoshop Elements and edited it, adding blurring effects and changing the saturation and hue of the colours. For the beep sounds when moving 
and completing a row, I found that online on a site filled with royalty free sound effects.
